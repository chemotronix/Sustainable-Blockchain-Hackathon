# Blockchain technologies with Hedera

Hedera enables us to build a scalable blockchain ecosystem, with minimal transaction fees. Hedera was used to create a token, which will interact with the standard hedera token service, and it essentially serves as carbon credits for users to mint, trade on the blockchain, enabling carbon emitters to burn credits when they want to effectively offset their carbon emissions as tracked by the IoT device.
